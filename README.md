# aether-nodemcu

This is a library for use with the NodeMCU development board and the Arduino IDE. It provides an interface for connecting to the Aether IOT Art platform: http://aether.mod.bz

At this stage it is very much Work In Progress

## Requirements:
1. A NodeMCU: http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html
    These are cheap, WiFi enabled microcontrollers. Traditionally you would use Lua scripts to program them, but some clever folks have       integrated it with the Arduino IDE, which brings us to ....
2. The Arduino ESP8266 Core: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino
    Make sure to install the Arduino IDE, and then collow the instructions in the above link.
3. The Arduino Websocket Library: https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets
    To ensure fast transfer of data, Aether requires you communicate with it via websockets.
    
## Installation:
1. Install git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
2. Clone aether-nodemcu into your arduino library folder: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository

## Example:
Here is some example code. It is included in the library's example folder.

By default, the log level is set to standard. The library does not initialise serial communication, however. You must either initialise the serial logger (Serial.begin(baudrate)) or set the log level to LOG_NONE.

See aether-client.h for all the functions

```
/*  This is a simple example that turns an LED on or off when it receives 
 *  a "pulse" message. A pulse is essentially an empty message; all that 
 *  matters is that we received a message to "do something". The sender
 *  could have been a button, as an example.
 */

#include <aether-client.h>

#define LED_PIN 2

/* Start the aether client */
AetherClient ae;

/* To keep track of whether the LED should be on or off */
int ledState = LOW;

/* As a receiver device, we must define a function to
 *  be called upon receipt of a message
 */
void receiveFunc()
{
  ledState = ledState?LOW:HIGH;
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, ledState);
}

void setup() 
{
  /* You must either begin serial (any baud rate), or set 
   *  log verbosity to LOG_NONE
   */
  Serial.begin(115200);

  /* init LED */
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, ledState);

  /* There are three levels:
   *  LOG_NONE (no output, do not need to called Serial.begin())
   *  LOG_STANDARD (set by default, some logging)
   *  LOG_VERBOSE (maximum logging)
   */
  ae.setLogVerbosity(LOG_VERBOSE);

  /* Stores whether we are connected to an access point yet */
  bool connection = false;

  /* while we are not connected to an access point */
  while(!connection)
  {
    /* Try connecting. You must provide the name of the 
     *  wireless network, and its password. You may
     *  provide an optional paramter specifying how 
     *  many milliseconds to wait before aborting the
     *  connecting attempt (defualt is 30000 milliseconds)
     */
    connection = ae.connectToAP("SSID", "PASSWORD");
    // connection = ae.connectToAP("SSID", "PASSWORD", 20000);
  }

  /* Connect to the Aether server. You must provide a 
   *  name for the device, a mode, and a data type.
   *  Possible modes are:
   *  MODE_RECEIVE, MODE_SEND
   *  Possible data types are:
   *  DATA_PULSE,
   *  DATA_BOOL,
   *  DATA_NUMBER,
   *  DATA_STRING
   */
  ae.connectToServer("Daniel", MODE_RECEIVE, DATA_PULSE);
  /* If you have set the device to receive data, you MUST
   *  provide a function to be called upon receipt of a 
   *  message. This MUST return void, and take a single argument
   *  consistent with the data type. The argumnet may be:
   *  void - for pulse
   *  bool - for boolean
   *  float - for number
   *  const char* - for string
   */
  ae.receiveData(receiveFunc);

}

void loop() 
{
  /* You need to call loop within the loop */
  ae.loop();
}
```
